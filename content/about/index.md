<ul> 
  <li>Developed POC for an end to end object detection pipeline using satellite images for tracking repairs of damaged roofs.</li>
  <li>The inference pipeline solved issues for running ML models on very high resolution images and bounding box resolution.</li>
  <li>The work included dataset creation and annotation, satellite imagery pre and post processing, model benchmarking and a <a href="https://tarp-detection.spacesense.ai/" target="_blank"><b>demo website.</b></a></li>
</ul>

{{< timelineItem icon="manipal" header="Dept. of Comp. Apps, MAHE" subheader="Research Project" badge="Aug 2019 - Aug 2020">}}
<ul> 
  <li>Implemented SOTA object detection architectures such as YOLOv3 and RetinaNet for localisation of humans in aerial and thermal images.</li>
  <li>As a key member of the research team, I tackled major challenges including boosting the speed of detection and accurately detecting small objects.</li>
  <li>My in-depth understanding of different object detection architectures allowed me to make significant contributions to our use case</li>
  <li>I helped in creating plots and creating the training pipeline for the SSD model for our paper <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/11/7/1151" target="_blank"><b>"Human Detection in Aerial Thermal Images Using Faster R-CNN and SSD Algorithms</b></a>"</li>
</ul>
