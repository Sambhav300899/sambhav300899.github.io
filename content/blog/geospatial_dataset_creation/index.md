## Motivation
I am working as an industry expert in a team under [Dr.Nadia Ahmed](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadia-a/) in a research project at [UC Irvine](https://uci.edu/). We will be exploring the applications of satellite imagery for animal migration tracking. The purpose of the flowchart below is to provide a mental model to the other team members regarding geospatial dataset creation.

## Flowchart 
Keep in mind that the data used in this flowchart is hypothetical, and some abstractions/assumptions were made to make it easier to understand. 

**I would recommend viewing it in a separate browser window.** 

P.S - Miro is awesome!

## Explanation and recording
I ended up giving a impromptu lecture on it for the team. You can find a recording of the same below. This included an explanation of my [NeurIPS 2023 CCAI tutorial: Automating the creation of LULC datasets for semantic segmentation](https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/neurips2022/116) as well. I have divided the recording into sections for easier viewing.
