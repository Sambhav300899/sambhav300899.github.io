## Motivation
I'm working as an industry expert on a research project at [UC Irvine](https://uci.edu/), led by [Dr. Nadia Ahmed](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadia-a/). Our team is studying how satellite imagery can be used to track animal migration. To help my teammates understand the process of geospatial dataset creation, I created a flowchart. This flowchart gives a clear picture of the steps involved in preparing geospatial datasets for Machine Learning.

## Explanation and recording
I ended up giving an impromptu lecture on it for the team. This included an explanation of my [NeurIPS 2023 CCAI tutorial: Automating the creation of LULC datasets for semantic segmentation](https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/neurips2022/116) as well. I have divided the recording into sections for easier viewing. [I have put the tutorial recording at the end of the page](#automating-the-creation-of-lulc-datasets-for-semantic-segmentation). 



## Flowchart 
Keep in mind that the data used in this flowchart is hypothetical, and some abstractions/assumptions were made to make it easier to understand. 

**I would recommend viewing it in a separate browser window.** 

P.S - Miro is awesome!
