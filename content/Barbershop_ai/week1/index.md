## What is this?
This is my first week of building barbershop AI, an app to try out different hairstyles virtually.  The motive of the first week was to select an idea and this is the one I landed on. 

## Why?
The reasons why I want to build this app are - 
- **Having gotten shitty haircuts.** (you can say my haircut is garbage even now, don't worry)
- **Language barriers** - Living as an expat in Paris, it's been hard to explain what I want to barbers.
- **Trying it out before its permanent** - Reference pictures don't fully allow me to imagine what a haircut looks like on me, if I could do that it would be great. 
- **Curiosity** - This is an interesting problem for me from a theoretical point of view. 

## The Goal
- Start
- Track my progress and learnings.
- Have a working demo by the end of 6 weeks.
- See if my idea sparks any interest in others.
- ????
- profit?
