They call this the \u0026ldquo;data engine\u0026rdquo;\n  To achieve strong generalisations to new data distributions, it was necessary to train SAM on large and diverse set of masks.   No existing dataset satisfied these requirements.\n  They use \u0026lsquo;model in the loop\u0026rsquo; annotation.\n  3 stages to the \u0026ldquo;data engine\u0026rdquo; -   Assisted-manual\n Model assists annotators in annotation.     Semi-auto.\n  Model can generate annotations for a subset of objects by prompting with likely object locations and masks. (is this because of good performance after stage 1?)\n  Annotators annotate the rest of the objects.\n    Fully auto\n  Model is prompted with a regular grid of foreground points. (what does this mean?)\n  This results in generation of ~100 high quality masks per image             Final dataset - The final dataset, SA-1B, includes more than 1B masks from 11M licensed and privacy-preserving images. The masks were manually verified to have good annotations.   Focused on AI ethics to look at potential geographical and racial biases the model might have\n  Experiments\n  Tested using 23 segmentation datasets to find out that it generated high-quality masks from a single foreground point, these annotations were only slightly below the ground truth.   Got good results on zeroshot downstream tasks such as edge detection, object proposal generation, instance segmentation and preliminary exploration of text-to-mask prediction\n  These results suggest that SAM can be used out-of-the-box with prompt engineering to solve a variety of tasks involving object and image distributions beyond the model\u0026rsquo;s training data.\n     Task #   The promptable segmentation task is to return a valid segmentation mask given any prompt. “Valid” here means that a segmentation mask should be returned even if the prompt is ambiguous. Look at the figure below to understand what ambiguous means here.    This task was chosen since it acts as a natural pre-training algorithm and a general method for zero-shot transfer to downstream tasks via prompting.\n  One suggested method of using for downstream instance segmentation\n For example, if one has a bounding box detector for cats, cat instance segmentation can be solved by providing the detector’s box output as a prompt to our model.    An important distinction pointed out by them is that the model is not trained in a multitask scenario but can perform different tasks at inference tasks by pairing it with different components.\n   Model #    Three main components -   image encoder\n  They use masked autoencoder (MAE) pre-trained ViT adapted to process high res outputs.   What is a masked autoencoder?\n    a flexible prompt encoder\n  Prompts are broken down into 2 categories-   Sparse - points, boxes and text   Dense - mask\n  Points and boxes are encoded using positional embeddings   Text is converted to embeddings using CLIP encoder.\n  Dense prompts are encoded using convolutional operations.\n    fast mask decoder\n  The mask decoder efficiently maps the image embedding, prompt embeddings, and an output token to a mask.\n  The modified decoder block uses prompt self-attention and cross-attention in two directions (prompt-to-image embedding and vice-versa) to update all embeddings.\n  After running two blocks, we upsample the image embedding and an MLP maps the output token to a dynamic linear classifier, which then computes the mask foreground probability at each image location\n      The model was modified to allow for multiple masks being generated for a single prompt. This is to tackle ambiguity in the prompts. They set the limit of masks generated to 3, as they found it to be sufficient for most usecases.   The model is designed to be efficient. The image encoder is the computationally heavy part of the model, afterwards the prompt encoder and mask decoder can run efficiently even in a browser.\n  This design allows testing the model with different prompts very easily, since the image embeddings don\u0026rsquo;t need to be computed repeatedly.   Mask prediction - dice + focal loss was used for training.\n   Data Engine #    The data engine has three stages -   model-assisted manual annotation stage\n  Normal image annotation assisted by the model in an interactive browser UI environment\n  No named labels for the objects were collected.\n  The model was trained on common segmentation datasets before this and then on the slice of the data that had been annotated in stage 1.\n  4.3M masks were collected from 120k images in this stage.\n  Model was trained 5-6 times during this phase\n    semi-automatic stage with a mix of automatically predicted masks and model-assisted annotation   The aim here was to increase the diversity of masks in order to improve the models ability to segment anything.\n  The model was allowed to make predictions first and then the less common objects were labelled by the annotators.\n  Model was trained 5-6 times during this phase.\n    fully automatic stage in which our model generates masks without annotator input\n  Enough data had been collected by this point to allow for the model to train automatically.\n  The model was prompted with 32 x 32 grid of points and tasked to predict the masks for these.\n  The concept of stable mask is introduced, a mask is stable if thresholding the probability map at 0.5 - delta and 0.5 + delta results in similar masks.   delta = 0.3\n  mask_over = mask \u0026gt; 0.5 + delta\n  mask_under = mask \u0026gt; 0.5 - delta\n  similarity(mask_over, mask_under)\n    After selecting confident masks NMS was applied to filter duplicates.   Fully automatic mask generation was applied to 11M images to generated 1.1B masks.\n      The SA-1B dataset has been released online, it consists of only generated masks.   A comparison of the generated masks was done with manually annotated masks and showed that the quality of the generated masks is good.   The authors performed a bias and fairness analysis of the dataset as well.    Zero-shot Experiments #    They analysed the performance of the model on different zero-shot experiments.   The tasks are as follows -   Edge detection\n  Generated segmentation masks and removed duplicates using NMS. These were generated by prompting the model with 16x16 grids of foreground points.   Edge maps are then computed using sobel filtering of un-thresholded mask probability maps and postprocessing.\n  It produced reasonable edge maps.     Object proposal generation\n To generate object proposals, they ran a slightly modified version of the automatic mask generation pipeline and output the masks as proposals.

Lets see how radar plots can help us quickly visually compare model performance across multiple metrics.\nThis is just a single use case of using radar plots though, these can be used for so much more such as - comparing multiple products across multiple metrics, comparing multiple people across multiple skills, etc.\nThe first time I appreciating radar plots was in Fifa 18, where you could compare players across pace, skill, strength, etc.very easily. Made quick substitutions very simple.\nVisually they look very cool and are certain to add visual flair to your next presentation.\n What are radar plots? #  Defining them a bit more formally, a radar plot is a type of chart used to display multiple variables on a two-dimensional graph. Each variable is plotted on a separate axis that radiates from the center of the graph, and data points are connected to create a polygon shape.\nRadar plots are commonly used to compare the performance of different models or entities across multiple metrics. They are helpful for visualizing how different variables affect overall performance and are widely used in fields such as data analysis, engineering, and sports.\n Sample data #  Here we will just be using a randomly generated table of data. Lets say we have a hypothetical image to image translation problem. We will compare 3 models across 4 metrics SSIM, PSNR, MAE and MSE. We load this in the form of a pandas dataframe named sample_df.\n   NOTE! Keep in mind the data makes no sense in terms of metrics and is only meant for visualisation purposes!     Model SSIM MAE MSE PSNR     Model_1 -0.1 2.1 4.70 32.6   Model_2 0.5 0.5 0.45 54.1   Model_3 0.9 0.3 0.12 15.4     Data Normalisation #  The data needs to be normalized before we can plot it. This is because we are plotting multiple metrics on the same scale, so our values also need to be on the same scale.\nlets normalize all of our data to be between 0 and 1.\n SSIM varies b/w -1 and 1, to normalize we just add 1 and divide by 2. MAE can be vary between 0 and infinity, lets assume max valye is 3 for MAE. Same case as MAE, max value assumed to be 5 PSNR for 8-bit grayscale images typically varies b/w 0-60 dB, so here lets - just normalize by dividing by 60.  sample_df[\u0026quot;SSIM\u0026quot;] = (sample_df[\u0026quot;SSIM\u0026quot;] + 1) / 2 sample_df[\u0026quot;MAE\u0026quot;] = sample_df[\u0026quot;MAE\u0026quot;] / 3 sample_df[\u0026quot;MSE\u0026quot;] = sample_df[\u0026quot;MSE\u0026quot;] / 5 sample_df[\u0026quot;PSNR\u0026quot;] = sample_df[\u0026quot;PSNR\u0026quot;] / 60 This is what the data looks like after normalization.\n   Model SSIM MAE MSE PSNR     Model_1 0.45 0.70 0.94 0.54   Model_2 0.75 0.16 0.09 0.90   Model_3 0.95 0.10 0.02 0.25     Plotting the data #  We will use good ol' matplotlib to create our plots. The following function is used to create the plots. The different parts of the codes are explained in the comments.\ndef radar_plot(df, attrs_to_plot, color_list=[\u0026#34;r\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;g\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;b\u0026#34;], title=\u0026#34;Radar plot\u0026#34;): # get the number of different metrics to plot n_metrics = len(attrs_to_plot) # we get the angles for each different metric angles = list(np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, n_metrics, endpoint=False)) # get label for each metric labels = list(attrs_to_plot) # we need the plot to be closed, so we close the plot # by adding the first metric at the end again angles += angles[:1] labels += labels[:1] # pass polar as true for ciruclar plot fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 6), subplot_kw=dict(polar=True)) # Set the labels for each of the angles ax.set_thetagrids(np.degrees(angles), labels=labels) # since we normalized all of our data to be between 0 and 1 # we set the limits of the plot to be between 0 and 1 ax.set_ylim(0, 1) for color, index_name in zip(color_list, df.index): # get the values for each row of the metrics # do note that we set the model name as the index vals = list(df[attrs_to_plot].loc[index_name]) # wrap around the values so that the plot is closed vals += vals[:1] # plot the polygon ax.plot(angles, vals, linewidth=1, color=color, label=index_name) # fill the area with color ax.fill(angles, vals, alpha=0.25, color=color) plt.legend(loc=\u0026#34;upper right\u0026#34;, bbox_to_anchor=(1.3, 1), fontsize=11) plt.title(title, fontsize=14, pad=10) Do note that the index of the sample_df has been changed to be the model name instead of numeric values. We then call the radar_plot as follows -\nradar_plot( sample_df, attrs_to_plot=[\u0026#34;SSIM\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;MAE\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;MSE\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;PSNR\u0026#34;], title=\u0026#34;Radar plot for model comparison\u0026#34;) One of the issues we see here is that there is a mix of negatively(lower is better) and positively(higher is better) oriented scores. This can create a bit of confusion when looking at the plot. Maybe if we invert the MSE and MAE using(1 - metric_value) then it might make more sense?\nPlotting after inverting using the following code -\nsample_df[\u0026#34;MAE_rev\u0026#34;] = 1 - sample_df[\u0026#34;MAE\u0026#34;] sample_df[\u0026#34;MSE_rev\u0026#34;] = 1 - sample_df[\u0026#34;MSE\u0026#34;] radar_plot( sample_df, attrs_to_plot=[\u0026#34;SSIM\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;MAE_rev\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;MSE_rev\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;PSNR\u0026#34;], title=\u0026#34;Radar plot for model comparison\u0026#34;, )  Conclusions #  Hmm\u0026hellip;, honestly still confusing. I think this can lead to confusion in explaining what rev_mae and rev_mse is. I think the better approach would be to plot negatively and positively oriented metrics on different plots altogether.\nBut regardless, these plots can be used for so much more than just comparing model metrics and can be used for comparing input features or data samples together. Here are some pros and cons of these plots.\nPros-\n Gives a nice summary of the different metrics/features for different models/data samples etc. Way better than looking at a table and trying to identify what each model is best at. Radar plots are visually very easy to understand and look nice aesthetically. Can be adjusted very easily for multiple metrics.  Cons -\n More models/samples can result in visual clutter. e.g - plotting the performance of 10 models like this would look horrible. All data needs to be normalized before plotting. Mixing of positive and negative oriented metrics can lead to confusion. It is very hard to compare to radar plots if the range and variables are different.
